Notes:

* problem 2 has the wrong reported roots

* problem 3 reports the wrong tolerances (10e-10 vs 1e-10, 10e-6 vs
  1e-6 -- these are both off by a factor of 10); otherwise the results
  look good and converge to the correct root.

Comments (for details see sticky notes in files.pdf):

* prob2.m -- my guess as to the error is that you have the wrong f(x)
  and f'(x) functions.  Since you determined these on paper and
  simplified to get the form that you put here I cannot see where the
  error was made.

* prob3.m -- indeed your tolerances are both off by a factor of 10.
  Otherwise this code looks good.
