General notes:
  
* I see no files that appear to contain the new generalized
  trapezoidal method (by name, at least).  I'm guessing that this is
  inside trapezoidal.hpp and trapezoidal.cpp.  In general, it's best
  practice to create *new* files to contain new solvers.
  

Compilation:  
  
* 1 warning message during compilation of prob2.cpp:

      prob2.cpp:36:3: warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]
        }  
        ^
      1 warning generated

  this happens because your function has return type 'int' but you do not
  'return 0' at the end.  It's best to remove all warning messages
  before "finishing" any codes.

  Otherwise, everything compiled perfectly.


Running prob2.exe:  
  
* perfect

  
Running prob5.exe:  
  
* I did NOT want the solution and error to be output every dtout; I
  only wanted the max norm error in time to be output at the end.
  That said, my instructions seem a bit unclear, so I won't deduct
  points for the extraneous output.

* your convergence rates and error values are perfect.


Building test_gen_trap.exe:  

* you did NOT follow the specific instructions on naming your new
  class, so my test code does not compile.  If I modify my testing
  code to use your [incorrectly named] class, it compiles fine.

  
Running test_gen_trap.exe:  
  
* perfect
