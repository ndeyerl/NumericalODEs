General notes:
  
  
Compilation:  
  
* both prob2.exe and prob4.exe build perfectly

  
Running prob2.exe:  
  
* perfect

  
Running prob4.exe:  
  
* In the instructions:  "At each output time, compute the relative
  error in the solution (but do not display)" -- you display all of
  these to the screen.

* other than the above error, your results look good.


Building test_hw4.exe:  
  
* perfect  


Running test_hw4.exe:  
  
* your results for both AB3 and AdaptRKF look great.  However, the
  time step and failure data that you report for your AdaptRKF look
  way too small.  Perhaps your counters do not store the "total"
  numbers of these quantities, and only the amount from the
  most-recent call?
