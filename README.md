Code for numerical ordinary differential equations algorithms from MATH 6321 at SMU (Fall 2016 with Dan Reynolds).  Majority of code is in C++, except for final project which is in Matlab. Coursework involved implementing numerical ordinary differential equation algorithms for solving and error analysis. We employed version control during this course, and this repo has been transferred to github from bitbucket.
