Compilation:  
  
* compiles fine

  
Running prob1.exe:  
  
* your error values are perfect, but your orders of convergence seem
  off.  I'll investigate when I look at your code.

Running prob3.exe:  
  
* your errors are within tolernaces, but your codes seem to use an
  excessive number of internal time steps.  Again, I'll investigate
  when looking at your files.

Building test_adapt_euler.exe:  
  
* builds fine

Running test_adapt_euler.exe:

* I get many warnings that your code is returning the solution at a
  time other than tspan[1].  I'll investigate in your codes directly.

* Also, your code takes WAY too long to finish the tests, so I killed
  it after 15 minutes.  Again, I'll have to investigate when I look at
  your codes directly.
